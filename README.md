> *Y.A.M.S.* stands for "Yet Another Managements System" (no pun intended ðŸ˜‰). This project is being developed
> for educational purposes, so don't expect much of it ðŸ™ƒ.

## What is this?

*Y.A.M.S* is a management system developed to make the day-to-day of a microcomputer assistance
more practical and efficient. The final product should be capable of managing:

- Clients.
- Service Orders.
- Payments.
- Stock.
- Reports.

The development was divided in the following phases:

- [x] Phase I: Modeling of the system trough Class and Use Case Diagrams.
- [ ] Phase II: Implementation of the base models and DAOs for the CRUD operations,
  as well as the creation of the unit tests.
- [ ] Phase III: Assure the persistence of the system's information, through files or DB.
- [ ] Phase IV: Construction of the GUI using JavaFX.

## How to use it?

> **Warning**: Y.A.S.M. is currently under development, so you won't probably be able
> to do much until I reach Phase IV ðŸ™ƒ.
