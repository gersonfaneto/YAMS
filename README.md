## About

**Y.A.M.S.** is a management system developed to make the day to day of a microcomputer assistance
more practical and efficient. The final product should be capable of:

- Registering and keeping important information from the "Clients" of the assistance.
- Creation of "Work Orders" from the "Clients", which must be carried out in order of arrival.
  - The "Work Orders" must contain one or more of the following "Services":
    - Assembly - Component Installation:
      - RAM - Price: R$ 20.00
      - Motherboard - Price: R$ 100.00
      - Power Supply - Price: R$ 30.00
      - Graphics Card - Price: R$ 100.00
      - HD/SSD - Price: R$ 30.00
      - Others - Price: _To be defined!_
    - Cleaning - Price: R$ 70.00
    - Formatting - Price: R$ 50.00
    - Programs Installation - Price: R$ 10.00
- Generating "Invoices" referring to the "Work Orders" and receiving "Payments" for them from
  different methods.
- Creating "Purchase Orders" for the "Components" needed for the realization of the "Services".
- Generating "Reports" for the "Services" containing relevant information, like: time waited, client
  rating and used components.

The development was divided in the following phases:

- [x] Phase I: Modeling of the system trough Class and Use Case Diagrams.
- [x] Phase II: Implementation of the base models and DAOs for the CRUD operations,
      as well as the creation of the Unit Tests.
- [x] Phase III: Assure the persistence of the system's information.
- [ ] Phase IV: Construction of the GUI using JavaFX.

## Usage

> **Warning**: **Y.A.S.M.** is currently under development, so you won't probably be able
